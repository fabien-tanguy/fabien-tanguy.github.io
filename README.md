# Hi, I'm Fabien Tanguy

Senior Software Engineer (14+ years experience) with a strong focus on  
**data**, **SQL/PLSQL**, and **reliable application design**.

I care about systems that last: clean models, predictable behaviour,  
and code that survives more than one hype cycle.

My background started in frontend engineering, but over the years my work  
naturally gravitated toward **data modeling**, **business logic**,  
and **performance-driven architectures**.

## 🔧 Core Expertise

- **Data & SQL**
  - Oracle Database SQL, relational modeling, query optimisation
  - Referential integrity, constraints, normalization
  - Designing database-centric application logic

- **Oracle Ecosystem**
  - Oracle APEX for low-code, data-centric applications
  - Oracle Data Platform foundations (cloud data services, Autonomous DB, etc.)
  - Focus on building maintainable, business-oriented solutions

- **Backend & Application Logic**
  - Node.js, TypeScript, REST APIs
  - Transactional workflows, validation rules, error handling
  - PostgreSQL & Oracle in real-world projects

- **Frontend (legacy strength)**
  - 10+ years with React, Next.js, TypeScript
  - Architecture, design systems, performance, DX

## 🤝 How I work

- Senior mindset: clarity, ownership, and pragmatism  
- Comfortable bridging **product, frontend, backend and data**  
- Used to working with non-technical stakeholders (product, métiers, ops)  
- Calm under pressure, with a taste for long-term durability over short-lived trends

## 🔍 What you’ll find here

Right now, this GitHub is focused on:

- Small labs and practical examples around **Oracle SQL** and **data modeling**
- Experiments with **Oracle APEX** for data-centric applications
- Backend patterns in **TypeScript / Node.js** talking to relational databases
- A few open-source utilities and experiments, kept intentionally simple and readable

More real-world, less “toy code”.
